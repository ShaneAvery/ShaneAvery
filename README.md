- Hi, I’m @ShaneAvery
- I’m interested in writing code again.
- I’m currently (re)learning Python.
- I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can get my hands on writing pure Python, either as practice or to be useful. 
- I want to get to a point where any problem given to me that requires code I can basically be able to solve using Python due to knowing it inside and out for the most part.
- Reaching me on Twitter @TheShaneAvery will be the best place for the time being.
