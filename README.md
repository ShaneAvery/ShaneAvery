- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShaneAvery
- 👀 I’m interested in writing code again.
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can get my hands on writing pure Python, either as practice or to be useful. 
- I want to get to a point where any problem given to me that requires code I can basically be able to solve using Python due to knowing it inside and out for the 
- most part. The idea is to get a full time job using my skills with Python.
- 📫 Reaching me on Twitter @ShaneAveryMedia will be the best place for the time being.
